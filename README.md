# CHIP8 Emulator

A CHIP8 emulator written in C that implements the CHIP8 instruction set and provides a simple window-based display interface.

## Features

- Complete CHIP8 instruction set implementation
- Window-based display using Windows API
- Keyboard input support
- Memory management
- Stack operations
- Timer support (delay and sound)
- Sprite rendering

## Prerequisites

- MinGW-w64 (GCC compiler for Windows)
- Make (optional, for using Makefile)

## Building on Windows

1. Install MinGW-w64:
   - Download MinGW-w64 from [MinGW-w64 Downloads](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases)
   - Extract to a directory (e.g., `C:\mingw64`)
   - Add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CHIP8-EMU.git
cd CHIP8-EMU
```

3. Compile the project:
```bash
gcc src/*.c -o chip8.exe -I./include
```

Or using the provided Makefile:
```bash
make
```

## Running the Emulator

After compilation, you can run the emulator with a CHIP8 ROM file:
```bash
./chip8.exe path/to/your/rom.ch8
```
